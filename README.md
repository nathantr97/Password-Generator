# Password Generator Application


## Description

The idea of this project was to create a webpage using Javascript that will help users generate a random password with user inputs. This project required me to do more research and take a closer look into my process of debugging, running multiple trials and improving the application. This Password Generator project is a great opportunity to explore Console and how functions respond and interact with users behind the webpage. 


## Installation


<li> First, create a Github repository that contains the code. </li>
<li> Then, nagivate to the appropriate folder and open the cloned code in VS. </li>
<li> Set values for variables and write conditional statements under script.js file. </li>
<li> Complete Git flow throughout the process to save local changes to GitHub </li>
<li> Publish site and make sure to run tests on all prompts. </li>
